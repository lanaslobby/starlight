			<p> "I can't relate to desperation" but I actually can, Imposter Syndrome and all.
			While it's all fun and games to have a shot or two in the morning, nobody's laughing when I'm jittery from all the caffeine shot up my system so quickly.
		Do you still want to have this? Think about it, it's not even pleasant tasting.</p>

				<ul>
				<p>My favorite kind because it's so balanced and nice.
				I like how smooth and soothing it is to have a nice creamy cup of cappuccino with a heart on top of it. 
			It's never as good as a barista's but I try.
		It always ends up looking like a disheveled frog, anyway.</p>

					<h3 id="Latte">Latte</h3>
				<ul>
				<p>It tastes too much like milk and not enough like coffee so no.
				Makes me wonder if this is made for babies so they can stay up but then, who wants babies to stay up so badly?
			They need their rest. Do not feed this to babies.</p>
